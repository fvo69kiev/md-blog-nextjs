## Trimming the hair on the pads of the paws, which facilitates their washing and drying after walking

**Hair Grooming Between the Toes**
The hair between the toes needs to be properly groomed because it can trap splinters, pebbles, or debris. Tow hair is also prone to catching bacteria from wet surfaces that your dog might have walked on or from other dirty surfaces.

**Maintaining Paw Pads**
Dog's paw pads become rough to facilitate walking on rough surfaces. You should not prevent this hardening by letting your dog walk only on soft surfaces. However, you must take care of hardened paw pads as well.

**Avoid Cracking**
Due to being extremely tough, paw pads tend to break and bleed when they get too dry. To prevent this, you can apply specialized dog paw pad moisturizers. Avoids using lotions made for humans as they can be too soft for a dog's pads.
