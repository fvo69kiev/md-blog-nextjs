**Tripping** to a certain category of dogs with stiff fur, which are not cut with scissors or a clipper, and with the help of fingers or a special tool to remove hair that has already passed all stages of growth, allowing new growth.
Only with proper care do dogs with stiff fur remain in purebred form and with shiny correct coat and are fairly easy to care for at home.
Such dogs are less polluted and their fur is not tangled.
If you cut such breeds with a clipper, the property of the wool changes almost after the first procedure.
The skeletal hair dies and the dog begins to grow undercoat, which has a soft, thin structure, and curls.
The owner as a result gets a huge problem in caring for such a dog.
As this wool absorbs all the dirt and dust from the street, it becomes tangled and swollen.
Also, the dog loses its pedigree appearance.
Therefore, we explain to all owners of hard-haired breeds why their dogs need to be trimmed, not cut.
