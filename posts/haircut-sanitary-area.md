## Shortening of hair on hygienic areas under the tail, which prevents the formation of unpleasant odors

Sanitary trims, sometimes called “potty cuts,” keeps heiny hair free of tangles, mats, and traps for urine, feces, dirt, associated bacteria and odors. Besides the ick-factor, these things not only spread around your environment, but also leave your dog at risk for developing irritation and infection if left unchecked. Luckily, it’s easy to safely give your dog a sanitary trim at home.

Remember, grooming should be a positive and painless experience for your best furry friend, so a slow and careful touch is essential. Your dog’s backside and belly are especially sensitive areas that should only be very gently cleaned, brushed, and trimmed. If your dog isn’t accustomed to regular grooming or sanitary trims, it may be helpful to find an assistant or employ a treat dispenser to provide a distraction and positive reinforcement.
