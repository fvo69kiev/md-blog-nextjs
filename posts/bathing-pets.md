## Bathing takes place in 3 stages.

1. Bathing with a deep cleansing shampoo that washes away all dirt and odors.
2. Bathing with shampoo, which is selected depending on the condition of the hair and gives it a healthy and well-groomed look.
3. Conditioner for shine, hydration, easy combing and spectacular appearance of your pet's fur.
