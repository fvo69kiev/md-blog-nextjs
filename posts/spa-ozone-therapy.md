## Ozone therapy
That procedure is necessary for those animals that have problems with dry skin and fur, brittle hair, frequent swallowing, alopecia in Spitz and others.

Also a great procedure for show animals to enhance the beauty of wool or restore it in the inter-exhibition period.
Excellent procedure during laziness. Helps to get rid of old hair faster and increase the brightness of new ones.

Of course, this procedure helps to relax, calm the nervous system and the animals really like it.
We will always choose a spa complex according to the type of wool and your wishes.

## How Ozone Heals
In the body, ozone combines with amino acids and lipids to create compounds called ozonides.

These ozonides are what actually cause the biological effects of ozone. They can easily pass through cell membranes and exert their main effect … which is to improve energy production through improved oxygen utilization.

That’s why it’s so effective. Cellular degeneration often stems from an inability of the cells to use oxygen efficiently. So ozone therapy can improve the health and function of the body’s cells.

Cells’ ability to use oxygen depends on the amount of NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) that’s available to them. Ozone promotes an oxidation reaction that creates NAD from NADH. (NADH is NAD plus 1 hydrogen atom.)  This then provides more energy that the cell can use to function optimally.

Once the cells have the proper amount of energy to work effectively, tissues in the body can heal.  Ozonides are also very stable, lasting from days to weeks in the body. This prolongs the benefits of ozone long after the actual treatment.
