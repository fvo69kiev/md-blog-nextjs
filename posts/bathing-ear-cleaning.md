## How to Clean Dog Ears: A Summary
Now that you know how to clean dog ears, here are the basics one more time:

1. Know what a healthy, clean ear looks and smells like.
2. Check your dog’s ears regularly after bathtime.
3. Cleaning ears too often can cause excessive irritation
4. Use a veterinarian-approved ear-cleaning solution for dogs.
5. Contact your veterinarian if you suspect your dog has an ear infection.

Taking care of your dog’s ears helps prevent infections. Regular ear examinations will also catch any other problems, such as ear mites, before they get worse, and will desensitize your dog to ear handling.
