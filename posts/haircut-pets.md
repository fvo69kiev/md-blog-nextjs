If you need to bathe a dog or cat often, you will need a comprehensive haircut once a month, a maximum of two.
Hygienic haircut will be needed once every 3 weeks, depending on the breed and the time of regrowth.
It is not necessary to perform haircuts that contradict the breed principles and harm the health of animals!
