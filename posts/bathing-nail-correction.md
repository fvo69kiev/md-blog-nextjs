## How can I help my dog avoid broken nails?

To avoid the hassle of a broken nail, keep your dog’s nails trimmed.
Short nails are less likely to snag than long ones. Ask your veterinarian or veterinary technician to demonstrate proper nail trimming so you can clip your dog’s nails at home.
If you are not comfortable doing this, simply make regularly scheduled appointments to have your dog’s nails trimmed at the veterinary hospital.

Regardless of who does the clipping, the goal is to trim the nail as short as possible while avoiding the quick.
This is easier with white nails where the pinkish quick is readily apparent. Dark nails are more of a challenge.
The right tools are essential to successful trimming.
Sharp nail trimmers specially designed for dogs are a big plus.
**Dull trimmers shred the nail and increase the likelihood of a break.**

Keep maintenance of your dog’s nails on your list of tasks alongside bathing and walking so that you and your dog can avoid the broken nail dilemma.
