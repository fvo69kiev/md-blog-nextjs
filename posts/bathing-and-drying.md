## How Do I Blow-Dry a Dog?
So, how do you blow-dry? I'm so glad you asked.

**Start With a Towel Dry**
I do recommend towel drying first to get most of the moisture off and lessen the time it takes to blow-dry. Do not, for any reason, rub vigorously with the towel. The up-and-down, back-and-forth motion only makes mats and tangles in the fur! Try the squeegee method instead, pressing and squeezing all over to allow the towel to soak up as much water as possible. Then pull out your dryer and get to work!

**Choose the Right Dryer Setting**
Dryers nowadays have so many settings. I recommend using a warm setting on the highest airflow speed that your dryer allows. The higher the airflow, the faster the coat will dry (the amount of airflow may be noted on the box as CFM, for cubic feet per minute, or as FPM). If you are going to buy a new hairdryer soon, look to see if the CFM/FPM is noted on the box and buy the one with the highest number, especially if you have a thick-coated dog.

**Use Cool Air Intermittently**
If you have a button for cool air, you can use it intermittently so you don't overheat your pet. I do not recommend using only cool air. If you were wet all over, would you want to stand in front of a fan naked? No, of course not. So don't do that to your pet. If they are shivering, you should make the air a little warmer. Then blow-drying will be seen as a good thing and not as something to be avoided.

**Brush the Coat With Your Free Hand**
While you are blow-drying, use your free hand to brush through the coat as you go. This will help speed up the process.
