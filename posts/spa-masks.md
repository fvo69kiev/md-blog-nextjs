## SPA masks
That procedure is necessary for those animals that have problems with dry skin and fur, brittle hair, frequent swallowing, alopecia in Spitz and others.

Also a great procedure for show animals to enhance the beauty of wool or restore it in the inter-exhibition period.
Excellent procedure during laziness. Helps to get rid of old hair faster and increase the brightness of new ones.

Of course, this procedure helps to relax, calm the nervous system and the animals really like it.
We will always choose a spa complex according to the type of wool and your wishes.
