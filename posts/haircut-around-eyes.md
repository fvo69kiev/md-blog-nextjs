## How to Trim Hair from Your Dog's Eyes & Ears
Not all dog breeds require routine trimming of the coat around the eyes and ears, but all should undergo regular inspection and cleaning around these sensitive areas.
It will help prevent the development of infections that could seriously damage these vital organs.

Dogs with heavy, wiry, curly, corded, double or combination coats are likely to benefit from periodic trimming around the eyes and ears but many with short or smooth coats may never need it.
It’s a simple procedure with blunt scissors or the right trimmer. Cleaning should be done on a regular basis. Poodles and spaniels often incur tear stains under the eyes but these can be controlled by the use of warm water and a cotton ball. Never use soap near a dog’s eyes.

Dogs with floppy ears benefit from weekly ear cleaning but others generally can be cleaned on a monthly basis. Wahl has all of the tools to do the job.

What you need:

1. Cotton balls or gentle wash cloth
2. Gentle oil cleanser or wipes (for ears)
3. Blunt scissors or approved pet trimmer
